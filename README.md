This app is a turn-based battle game I worked on with a classmate.

The game pits DC Comic's Justice League against their arch-nemesis the Legion of Doom. The player has the ability to choose a hero.  Once a hero is selected the hero-selector disappears, the villain is declared, and the player is told to attack. When the player clicks attack, the villian responds by attacking.  This will update both players' health status.  The player continues to attack until someone is declared the winner.

The goal of this assignment was to teach me how and why to use prototypical inheritance.
